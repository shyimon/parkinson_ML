Dataset: ML-CUP25 

We address the ML-CUP25 regression task by investigating two neural architectures with different learning paradigms:
A constructive Cascade Correlation Network and a fixed-topology Multi Layer Neural Network.

Model 1: Cascade Correlation Network (Constructive Neural Network)
Validation: Hold-out validation on merged TR+VAL set (85/15 % split) for early stopping. Model selection performed via Grid Search.

Model 2: Multi Layer NN
Validation: Hold-out validation on VAL set (100 out of 500 examples) for early stopping. Model selection performed via Grid Search.

Although the final parameters have been decided through extensive Grid Search, we explored different possibilities, and in particular
we implemented the following learning tools and heuristics:
- Xavier and Uniform weight initialization

- {Half MSE; MSE; MAE; LogCosH; Huber; Binary Cross Entropy; MEE} Losses

-  SGD Backpropagation, RProp and QuickProp

- Sigmoid and TanH activation functions

- L2 Regularization

- Momentum for gradient descent

- Minibatch

- Learning rate decay based on patience (plateau detection)

###

The results for the blind test are based on the Multi Layer NN Model.
